# google_anlytics_API
My own project in which I acquire, process and explore data obtained from the Google Analytics API.
The project involves notebooks:
1) Download website traffic data from Google Analytics API
2) Processing the collected data
3) Exploration of the collected data
JSON files with access data are not attached. I created the code so that the process can run automatically, even if we are interested in a different date and different metrics. Tested and everything works :-)
